#Irudd Hangboard
Interval timer app for hangboarding. (Finger training for rock climbing)

Based on this excellent [vue + dotnetcore template](https://github.com/MarkPieszak/aspnetcore-Vue-starter).

The architecture is super overkill for this app but this is as much exploring new technology as making something useful for me.

* Debug using npm: `npm build dev`
* Debug using dotnet: `dotnet run` (NOTE: Only works if dotnet environment is set to Development)
* If dist breaks delete the dist folder and then run `npm install`

Tech used:

* vuejs
* dotnetcore
* vuex
* docker

# Irudd Hangboard
Interval timer app for hangboarding. (Finger training for rock climbing)

Based on this excellent [vue + dotnetcore template](https://github.com/MarkPieszak/aspnetcore-Vue-starter).

The architecture is super overkill for this app but this is as much about exploring new technology as making something useful for me.

* Debug using npm: `npm build dev` (Sets NODE_ENV and ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT for you)
* Debug using dotnet: `dotnet run` (Set NODE_ENV=development if running this way)
* If dist breaks delete the dist folder and then run `npm install`

Tech used:

* vuejs
* dotnetcore
* vuex
* docker
* webpack

The published app lives [here](https://hangboard.irudd.se/)

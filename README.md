#Irudd Hangboard
Interval timer app for hangboarding. (Finger training for rock climbing)

Based on this excellent [vue + dotnetcore template](https://github.com/MarkPieszak/aspnetcore-Vue-starter).

The architecture is super overkill for this app but this is as much exploring new technology as making something useful for me.

* Debug: `npm build dev`

The published app lives [here] (https://hangboard.irudd.se/)
